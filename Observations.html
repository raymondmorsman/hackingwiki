<h1>Differences ltrace and strace:</h1>
<p>do not trust on either output alone.</p>
<p>Both <strong>strace</strong> and <strong>ltrace</strong> are powerful command-line tools for debugging and troubleshooting programs on Linux: <strong>Strace</strong> captures and records all system calls made by a process as well as the signals received, while <strong>ltrace</strong> does the same for library calls.</p>

<h2>JWT sessions</h2>
<p>Data Integrity Failures</p>
<p>Let's think of how web applications maintain sessions. Usually, when a user logs into an application, they will be assigned some sort of session token that will need to be saved on the browser for as long as the session lasts. This token will be repeated on each subsequent request so that the web application knows who we are. These session tokens can come in many forms but are usually assigned via cookies. <strong>Cookies</strong> are key-value pairs that a web application will store on the user's browser and that will be automatically repeated on each request to the website that issued them.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you were creating a webmail application, you could assign a cookie to each user after logging in that contains their username. In subsequent requests, your browser would always send your username in the cookie so that your web application knows what user is connecting. This would be a terrible idea security-wise because, as we mentioned, cookies are stored on the user's browser, so if the user tampers with the cookie and changes the username, they could potentially impersonate someone else and read their emails! This application would suffer from a data integrity failure, as it trusts data that an attacker can tamper with.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to use some integrity mechanism to guarantee that the cookie hasn't been altered by the user. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, we could use some token implementations that allow you to do this and deal with all of the cryptography to provide proof of integrity without you having to bother with it. One such implementation is<strong> JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</strong>.</p>
<p>JWTs are very simple tokens that allow you to store key-value pairs on a token that provides integrity as part of the token. The idea is that you can generate tokens that you can give your users with the certainty that they won't be able to alter the key-value pairs and pass the integrity check. The structure of a JWT token is formed of 3 parts:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/11c86acaea05f98045cec5634e03e997.png" alt="JSON Web Tokens"></figure>
<p>The header contains metadata indicating this is a JWT, and the signing algorithm in use is HS256. The payload contains the key-value pairs with the data that the web application wants the client to store. The signature is similar to a hash, taken to verify the payload's integrity. If you change the payload, the web application can verify that the signature won't match the payload and know that you tampered with the JWT. Unlike a simple hash, this signature involves the use of a secret key held by the server only, which means that if you change the payload, you won't be able to generate the matching signature unless you know the secret key.</p>
<p>Notice that each of the 3 parts of the token is simply plaintext encoded with base64. You can use <a href="https://appdevtools.com/base64-encoder-decoder">this online tool</a> to encode/decode base64. Try decoding the header and payload of the following token:</p>
<p><code>eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjY1MDc2ODM2fQ.C8Z3gJ7wPgVLvEUonaieJWBJBYt5xOph2CpIhlxqdUw</code><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The signature contains binary data, so even if you decode it, you won't be able to make much sense of it anyways.</p>
<p>JWT and the None Algorithm</p>
<p>A data integrity failure vulnerability was present on some libraries implementing JWTs a while ago. As we have seen, JWT implements a signature to validate the integrity of the payload data. The vulnerable libraries allowed attackers to bypass the signature validation by changing the two following things in a JWT:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the header section of the token so that the <code>alg</code>&nbsp;header would contain the value <code>none</code>.</li>
  <li>Remove the signature part.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking the JWT from before as an example, if we wanted to change the payload so that the username becomes "admin" and no signature check is done, we would have to decode the header and payload, modify them as needed, and encode them back. Notice how we removed the signature part but kept the dot at the end.</p>
