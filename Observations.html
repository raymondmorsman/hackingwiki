<p>Differences ltrace and strace:</p>
<p>do not trust on either output alone.</p>
<p>Both <strong>strace</strong> and <strong>ltrace</strong> are powerful command-line tools for debugging and troubleshooting programs on Linux: <strong>Strace</strong> captures and records all system calls made by a process as well as the signals received, while <strong>ltrace</strong> does the same for library calls.</p>
